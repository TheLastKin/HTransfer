## How to use
The app is mostly self-explanatory
But there are still some hidden stuffs such as:
- When viewing an image press Tab to go fullscreen
- Run A1111 script to display a tab switch button that can lead you to the web ui
- You can actually view images without having chosen a source by selecting a tag filter
- You can use arrow up and down to quickly load a source that you used before
- You can use arrow left and right to navigate between images of a source in single image view-
